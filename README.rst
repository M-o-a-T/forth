MoaT Forth

----------
Why Forth?
----------

Forth is cool. It's an interpreted language that can live in a few kBytes
of memory. Even with a register-optimizing compiler thrown in you can stay
below 20 kBytes.

You want to introspect *anything* on the target? Just use any
terminal program.

Its syntax is dead simple. Forth programs consist of words, any characters,
delimited by spaces. Yes, you can finally write code with emojis as
commands, though we'd ask you to not to. ðŸ¤”

On the minus side, Forth does take some getting used to. But so do all
these elaborate development environments (hello, Arduino).

Another and more relevant point against Forth is the lack of libraries for
common, or not-so-common, peripherals. This project's goal is to fix (some
of) this, by either including or pointing to a whole lot of Forth code for
your favorite IoT project.

In this author's not-quite-humble opinion, Forth as a language has a lot to
offer.

What's a MoaT?
--------------

The MoaT system is about tooling a wired bus for home automation using very
simple satellite controllers (where "simple" is anything with a Cortex M0+
or M3 and at least 64k of Flash; this is the 2020s after all).

This repository is about the Forth code that might run on these
satellites:

* There's a heap of peripherals to interface to. We want to control I/O
  ports from the bus. And PWM outputs. And PID control loops. And satellite
  serial ports. And things hanging off IÂ²C or SPI buses. And fancy RGB
  lights. And whatever other interesting peripherals there might be.

* Talking to a bus, or multiple peripherals at one, or whatever, requires
  interrupts and multitasking and buffers and all that. Or at least, having
  all that makes life a lot easier in the long run.

* Then there's dealing with the actual bus messages. Get a bus address,
  dispatch a message, send the reply, and all that.

  This repository is intended to contain code to support support a lot of this.

I'm not interested in some strange bus!
---------------------------------------

No matter. Focus on the first (and maybe the second) part. Most of the code
here is intended to be perfectly useable without the MoaT stuffing.

Umm, so, well, I may be interested.
-----------------------------------

Great!
Go to `the MoaT main archive <https://github.com/M-o-a-T/moat-bus>`_.

No, we don't have a running bus yet.

Final Thoughts
--------------

This author is admittedly somewhat opinionated in what should be considered
best practice when you're talking Forth (or rather, talking to something
that understands Forth).

Those are condensed in the `Coding Style <doc/meta/codingstyle.rst>`_ document
(the practical stuff), and the `Opinion <doc/meta/opinion.rst>`_ file for
the less-than-practical part.
