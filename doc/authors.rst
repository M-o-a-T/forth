The original author of the vocabulary management code is Manfred Mahlow
<manfred.mahlow@forth-ev.de>.

The multitasking code originated in the Mecrisp-Stellaris source code and
is unattributed.

Everything else, including intentional and/or unintentional mangling of the
original code, as well as most if not all bugs thereof, is likely to be the
fault of Matthias Urlichs <matthias@urlichs.de>.
