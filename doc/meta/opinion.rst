The author of this document would be the last person to acknowledge that
many statements in this documentation are more-or-less substantiated
assertions how things are done, should be done, might be done better, or
better shouldn't be done at all.

He does hope that these statements do not alienate those whose code is
included in, or referred to from, these documents. Likewise, the mangling
of external code that inevitably accompanies attempts to unify multiple
disparate styles into one hopefully-somewhat-coherent whole is certain to
alienate some authors of said external code.

However, projects need focus. A common style and a common way of doing
things have been proven to be more important to ultimately reach a goal
because you need to spend less time and mental capacity to decipher what
the *censored* this other author could possibly have meant as she indented
her code by a mixture of ttw and five spaces.

Even if you need to get used to it.
